# 🦍🔥 Primal Fire

**Primal Fire** is a fast-paced, VR multiplayer fangame inspired by **Gorilla Tag**, with a wild twist — **guns**. Climb, swing, launch yourself across dynamic arenas, and engage in primal combat with your fellow apes using a mix of agility and firepower.

## 🎮 About the Game

In **Primal Fire**, you move like a gorilla — running, climbing, and swinging using just your hands. But unlike traditional Gorilla Tag, **you’re not just fleeing — you’re fighting**. Equip a variety of guns and blast through other players in intense VR battles while keeping the fluid movement that makes Gorilla Tag unique.

### 🧠 Key Features
- **Gorilla-style locomotion** — no joysticks, just physics-based hand movement
- **Multiplayer VR Combat** — fight others online with real-time shooting and movement
- **Weapon system** — pistols, rifles, and more to come

- **Intense vertical gameplay** — climb trees, walls, and buildings to gain the high ground
